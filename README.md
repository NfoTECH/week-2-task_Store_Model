## READ PRODUCT DATA FROM AN EXCEL SHEET
### Problem Description
Continuing from the store task, you are to read data from an excel spreadsheet and create an array of product objects for your store. Products should be categorized for easy access by the cashier and customers. Product out of stock should have a value of “OUT OF STOCK” to prevent the purchase of products that are not available


### How will I complete this project?
1. Write automated test
2. Organize the folders for your module (application), to house both your code base and the tests.
3. Write tests to cover all the methods to be written before development begins (TDD (Test Driven Development)).
4. Make logical assumptions where necessary.



### Steps to evaluate
5. Classes 
   * At minimum UML should be used.
   * The right visibility modifiers should be used.
   * The following concepts/constructs should be used as much as possible
       * Encapsulation
       * Inheritance
       * Polymorphism
       * Interfaces/Abstract classes
       * Single Responsibility for classes.
       * Abstraction
       * Aggregation
       * Composition
       * Generics
       * Collections
       * Exception Handling
6. Test Coverage
   * At minimum the tests should cover the methods as well as the conditions/procedures that the methods employ.
